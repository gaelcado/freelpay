## 1. Create a Separate Development Branch

```bash
# Create a new branch for roadmap implementation
git checkout -b roadmap-implementation

# When you want to go back to your main project
git checkout main
```

This allows you to experiment freely while keeping your main codebase untouched.

## 2. Set Up a Parallel Project Structure

Create a separate directory for your implementation experiments:

```bash
mkdir freelpay-sandbox
cd freelpay-sandbox
# Initialize a new project here
```

## 3. Use Feature Flags

Implement new features behind feature flags that can be toggled on/off:

```typescript
// In your configuration
const FEATURES = {
  PENNYLANE_INTEGRATION: false,
  DEFACTO_INTEGRATION: false,
  // other features...
}

// In your code
if (FEATURES.PENNYLANE_INTEGRATION) {
  // New PennyLane implementation
}
```

## 4. Create Sandbox Environments for APIs

For each external API (PennyLane, Defacto, PandaDoc, Swan):
- Create separate sandbox/test accounts
- Use different API keys for development vs. production
- Store these in separate environment files (`.env.development`, `.env.sandbox`)

## 5. Implement a Proof of Concept (POC)

Start with a small, isolated POC for each integration:

```
freelpay-poc/
├── pennylane-poc/
├── defacto-poc/
├── pandadoc-poc/
└── swan-poc/
```

Each POC can be a minimal implementation focusing on core functionality.

## 6. Use Docker for Isolation

Create Docker containers for each component to isolate them:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml example
services:
  pennylane-service:
    build: ./pennylane
    environment:
      - PENNYLANE_API_KEY=${PENNYLANE_SANDBOX_KEY}
    # other configuration...
```

## 7. Mock External Services

Create mock implementations of the external APIs for testing:

```typescript
// src/lib/api/pennylane/mock.ts
export const mockPennyLaneAPI = {
  createInvoice: async (data) => {
    console.log('Mock: Creating invoice', data);
    return { id: 'mock-invoice-123', status: 'created' };
  },
  // other methods...
};
```

## 8. Implement a Staging Environment

Set up a complete staging environment that mirrors your production setup but is isolated from it.

## Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 1 from your roadmap (infrastructure setup)
2. Create a minimal implementation of one API integration (e.g., PennyLane)
3. Test thoroughly in isolation
4. Gradually expand to include more components

This approach lets you experiment and learn while keeping your main project safe and stable.
